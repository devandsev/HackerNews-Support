It uses an alternative way of displaying comment tree. Advantages over traditional interfaces:
- You always see the parent of the comment you're currently reading
- Comment width doesn't get narrower no matter how deep in the tree you are
- You can easily skip subtrees that don't interest you by scrolling
- Swiping allows you to move in and out of subtrees with animated transitions that you fully control

It all works together to help you maintain context and keep track of where you are in the discussion tree. There are also: custom boards, search, in-thread search, anchors, reading list, recent items.
